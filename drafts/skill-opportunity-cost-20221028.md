# Skill Opportunity Cost 20221028

There are certain tasks that I am really good at doing. There are other tasks that I am not good at doing and that take forever for me to do. I should leverage my strengths. I am good at building software. I am not so good at talking and writing. The strategy that I should take according to my strengths and weaknesses is to keep building. A strategy that works for other people might not work for me.

In the same way that it doesn't make sense for someone to learn to code in middle age, it doesn't make sense for me to learn to talk. I need to just build and build and build.
